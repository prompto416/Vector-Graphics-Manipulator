# Vector Graphics Manipulator

the example program is in the main.c in order to compile the example just download the files and include the header, no external libary is needed except for the svg header file which contains svg and files function. Once you compile the code a file will be generated in the same folder as in the main.c.

ALternatively you can run the main executable program.

NOTE: svg.c is the same as main.c but I was playing around with it. 
Also there seems to be several files, this is due to the fact that I've also uploaded codeblocks project file.
 
The program create a scalable vector graphic from designated format consisting of coordinates,shapes and color  then saves it into an accessible svg file.

## Reference:
* Simple SVG libary in c from codedrome
